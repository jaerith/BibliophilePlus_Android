# Bibliophile+ (for Android)
Bibliophile+ is an Android mobile application (mainly intended for tablets) that was intended for the use of bibliophiles, 
especially those that were interested in how books influenced and reflected the world around them.  From inspiring songs to
showcasing physical locations, the goal of the app was to serve as an interactive encyclopedia for such trivia and the 
statistics behind it.

# Android Requirements
* The target platform should be a 7-inch screen at least.  (Supposedly, it could accommodate other screen sizes, but it 
was never tested with any device with a different screen size.)
* The minimum version for Android should at least be Ice Cream Sandwich (i.e., Version 4.0.4).
* This application requires permissions for INTERNET, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, and NETWORK_STATE.

# Notices
The trivia data itself has been omitted from the project, since I would prefer to keep that separate.
